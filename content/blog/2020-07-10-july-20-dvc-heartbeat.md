## News

### DVC 1.0 release

On June 22, DVC entered a new era: the
[official release of version 1.0](https://dvc.org/blog/dvc-1-0-release). After
several weeks of bug-catching with our pre-release, the team has issued DVC 1.0
for the public! Now when you
[install DVC through your package manager of choice](https://dvc.org/doc/install),
you'll get the latest version. Welcome to the future.

To recap, DVC 1.0 has some big new features like:

- Plots powered by Vega-Lite so you can compare metrics across commits
- New and easier pipeline configuration files- edit your DVC pipeline like a
  text file!
- Optimizations for data transfer speed

Read all the [release notes](https://dvc.org/blog/dvc-1-0-release) for more, and
stop by our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/dvwXA2N) if you need support
migrating (don't worry, 1.0 is backwards compatible).

### DVC is in the top 20 fastest-growing open source startups

Konstantin Vinogradov at [Runa Capital](https://runacap.com/) used the GitHub
API to
[identify the fastest growing public repositories on GitHub](https://medium.com/runacapital/open-source-growth-benchmarks-and-the-20-fastest-growing-oss-startups-d3556a669fe6)
in terms of stars and forks. He used these metrics to estimate the top 20
fastest growing startups in open source software. And guess what, DVC made the
cut! We're in great company.

In May, we had our
[first every virtual meetup](http://localhost:8000/blog/may-20-dvc-heartbeat).We

We've been busy! Although we are mostly homebound these days, there has been no
shortage of speaking engagements. Here's a recap.

Co-founders Dmitry and Ivan appeared on the HasGeek TV series
[Making Data Science Work](https://hasgeek.com/fifthelephant/making-data-science-work-session-3/)
to discuss engineering for data science with hosts
[Venkata Pingali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pingali/) and
[Indrayudh Ghoshal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indrayudhghoshal/). The
livestream is available for viewing on YouTube!

The same day, Dmitry appeared on the [MLOps.community](https://mlops.community/)
meetup to chat with host
[Demetrios Brinkmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/). They talked about
the open source ecosystem, the difference between tools and platforms, and what
it means to codify data.

## Community activity

We've been busy! Although we are mostly homebound these days, there has been no
shortage of speaking engagements. Here's a recap.

### Meetings and talks

- Co-founders Dmitry and Ivan appeared on the HasGeek TV series
  [Making Data Science Work](https://hasgeek.com/fifthelephant/making-data-science-work-session-3/)
  to discuss engineering for data science with hosts
  [Venkata Pingali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pingali/) and
  [Indrayudh Ghoshal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indrayudhghoshal/). The
  livestream is available for viewing on YouTube!
=======
I (Elle) gave another talk at the
[MLOps Production & Engineering World](https://mlopsworld.com/) meeting, called
"Adapting continuous integration and continuous delivery for ML". I shared an
approach to using GitHub Actions & GitLab CI to start using continuous
integration in ML model training- and it turns out, this conference is generally
very excited about GitHub Actions! In another talk, GitHub technical advocate
[Jonathan Peck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peckjon/), shared some great use
cases, including how he used an Nvidia Jetson Nano to run Actions. Generally,
the mood around GitHub Actions in the ML community is very encouraging for a
future with more automated data science practices.

Extremely early the next morning, I co-led a workshop with clinician-scientist
[Cris Lanting](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crislanting/?originalSubdomain=nl)
about developing strong computational infrastructure and practices in research
as part of the
[Virtual Conference on Computational Audiology](https://computationalaudiology.com/).

In addition to outlining key components of scientific reproducibility and
project management, Cris and I did some investigating. We conducted an informal
survey asking about the biggest barriers to making research reproducible and
shareable. Participants overwhelmingly answered that they lack time and
incentives. Difficulty managing dependencies (both data and software) was
another popular answer. Sounds a bit like softare before
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)... For the curious, the workshop
is still viewable!

Lastly, check out our virtual poster for
[SciPy 2020](https://www.scipy2020.scipy.org/)! We prepared a demo about
[packaging models and datasets like software](https://dvc.org/blog/scipy-2020-dvc-poster)
so they can be widely disseminated via GitHub.

### Good reads

Some excellent reading recommendations from the community:

- Data scientist Déborah Mesquita published a thorough guide to using new DVC
  1.0 pipelines in a sample ML project. It's truly complete, covering data
  collection to model evaluation, with detailed code examples. If you are new to
  pipelines, do not miss this!

- Caleb Kaiser of [Cortex](https://github.com/cortexlabs/cortex) (another
  startup in the Runa Capital's Top 20 list!) shared a thinkpiece about
  challenges from software engineering that can inform production ML. We really
  agree with what he has to say about reproducibility:

> You typically hear about “reproducibility” in reference to ML research,
> particularly when a paper doesn’t include enough information to recreate the
> experiment. However, reproducibility also comes up a lot in production ML.
> Think of it this way — you’re on a team staffed with data scientists and
> engineers, and you’re all responsible for an image classification API. The
> data scientists are constantly trying new techniques and architectural tweaks
> to improve the model’s baseline performance, while at the same time, the model
> is constantly being retrained on new data. Looking over the APIs performance,
> you see one moment a week ago where the model’s performance dropped
> significantly. What caused that drop? Without knowing exactly how the model
> was trained, and on what data, it’s impossible to know for sure.

- Mukul Sood wrote about the Real World, a place beyond Jupyter notebooks where
  data is non-stationary and servers are unreliable! He covers some very real
  challenges for taking a data science project into production and introduces
  the need for CI/CD practices in healthy, scalable ML applications.
